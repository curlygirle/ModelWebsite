          <h2>week one</h2>
          <p>
            GitHub: I am familiar with GitHub as I already had it set up last
            year when working on a game design group project, it was complicated
            at first especially when setting it up, but I eventually got the
            hang of it and now I understand it as well as how it works.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on Readings: ‘The Library of Babel’ was quite confusing
            at first I had to read it a couple of times before I understood what
            was being said as well as conduct some research, while doing my
            research I looked at images of the library of babel and that helped
            me understand what was being spoken about in the reading. Another
            thing I saw while doing my research was a website created by
            Jonathan Basile based on this written piece by Borges and I found to
            be very interesting to see this adaptation of these multiple books
            found in these hexagonal libraries, how the website was set up and
            how when interacting with the home page you can see how it moves
            through different word combinations per letter, which we know from
            Borges reading that the books are unique and they differ by a single
            letter/punctuation, which we see in the website. Something I found
            interesting was that so much information can be found on both the
            website as well as these books in the library for cures, futuristic
            technology etc. however chances of finding the information in the
            books are very low as you would need to know what you are looking
            for and understand it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Goals for this course: My goal for this course is to develop an
            understanding of the different coding languages and know how to use
            these languages when creating websites. I am really excited to
            create websites and to know more about what makes a website
            successful and implement that into my designs.
          </p>

          <h2>week two</h2>
          <p>
            Experience with starting html: Starting HTML has been a very
            exciting experience for me, the lecture videos have been so
            informative as to the steps we need to take when creating a website.
            I enjoyed playing around with it by adding the various texts and
            linking various pages you would find on the web to each other such
            as the home page to the about page. It has been amazing to see what
            goes into making a website along with doing it myself.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reading reflections: Why Should You Use HTML5 was one of the
            readings that dealt with why one should utilise certain divisions
            such as article and section along with explaining what each of them
            are and how one can use them to make your website more user
            friendly. How A Screen Reader User Accesses the Web: A Smashing
            Video touches on how when we create websites we need to keep in mind
            the users that are unable to read, see, etc. as it will make the
            information on the web easier to navigate through and grasp. Another
            thing that stood out was when the various sites were being portrayed
            in the video one of the websites code contents was not hidden
            properly therefore the screen reader picks up those and reads it to
            the user when it is not relevant to the page the user is on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on Internet histories: When watching the lecture on
            internet histories as well as looking at the timeline of the
            internet, I found it quite amazing to look back at where the
            internet all started and how it has grown over time along with
            looking at the ideas put into creating these various
            websites/applications/devices.
          </p>

          <h2>week three</h2>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: When it comes
            to the process of developing my website, it has been quite slow as
            it took me a while to establish the wireframe of my website such as
            what I want to portray in my website, where I want to portray it and
            how. However, within this week I have managed to finish it and I am
            quite happy with the results of it, and I cannot wait for it to look
            like my basic wireframe. The reason I took so long when it came to
            developing my wireframe was that I wanted my website to have all
            these extravagant features but then I grew to dislike them and
            realised that I would want to create something minimal. When it
            comes to the coding part of my website, I have only done the basics
            in HTML and experimenting with some CSS but nothing much for now, I
            hope in the next few weeks to come that I can do more coding for my
            website in both HTML and CSS.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Reflection on readings and lecture: After attending the lecture and
            engaging with the reading ‘Conventions and Context – by Mailloux’.
            The lecture tied into what UI/UX is by touching on the keyword
            ‘interactivity’ and what it is, for UX can be defined as your
            interaction as the user with the product and how interacting with
            the product makes you feel. It is important to have great UI/UX for
            it plays an important role in how the end user engages with it
            ensuring that when they engage with it, it is easy for them to grasp
            the basics of the website by using appropriate conventions– linking
            to the idea of establishing a user-friendly interface/website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thoughts on Supplementary material: I find the supplementary
            material to be quite informative and useful, for if I need something
            or if there is something I am unsure of, I can refer and take my
            time going through these lectures before seeking further help as the
            answer to the help I might need might be in the video. Watching them
            has been very insightful as I feel that I am gaining a better
            understanding of the work and it provides that extra information to
            the lectures done for the week.
          </p>

          <h2>week four</h2>
          <p>
            Experience continuing the development of my website: This week I
            played around with some of the CSS coding parts of my website to
            kind of get a feel as to how I want to style it in terms of the
            colours, fonts, etc. I found myself looking at various fonts and
            font ideas on Pinterest as I want the font of my website to be very
            minimal but also very pretty. I have also examined the previous
            wireframe layout of my website and I felt that some of the designs
            were a bit too much to do as a beginner in creating a website so I
            went back to my drawing board and a made a few changes which I am
            very happy about ( I also included a variety depending on what page
            I plan in creating so that I can try out the various looks on my
            website)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            How my wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI:
            When it comes to my wireframes, I feel they hold up to the readings
            along with the lectures on UI as it has been made simple and
            understandable for the user to engage with it instead of trying to
            figure out how my UI works within the game. In the reading, it
            states that having ‘great UI allows people to engage with the
            product without friction, not spending time trying to figure it out’
            (UIPin 2020) Another thing that I learnt from the reading that stood
            out is when designing the website it needs to be accessible for
            those who are visually impaired such as people with colour blindness
            or people who a blind. This stood out to me for when I watched last
            week’s YouTube video by Smashing Magazine wherein a blind screen
            reader user accesses various websites to see if they are good or
            not, there were a few in which the code that is supposed to appear
            as inviable to the user as it however when the website reader goes
            through it, it picks up some of these things that we who can see
            would not pick up for we do not normally use the screen reader. This
            is something I hope to try and incorporate in the wireframes and
            design of my website, as a website should be easy to access for all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            How does UI relate to interactivity: When we look at what UI and
            interactivity are they are defined as follows: UI is the graphical
            representation of a program or system that allows users to interact
            with it and Interactivity is how the user can interact with the UI
            and the system that it represents and to what degree. Therefore, a
            well-designed UI should be easy and fast, allowing users a full
            understanding of the features provided along with how to interact
            with them. The level of interactivity in the UI could have a major
            influence on the user experience, influencing how engaging and
            satisfying the interaction is for the user. An example of this is
            clear and easy-to-use navigation menus, clickable buttons, sliders,
            dropdown menus etc. which can help users to engage more actively
            with the website and achieve their outcomes more efficiently.

          <p>
            Reflection on this week’s readings: I feel that the reading ‘The
            Basic Principles of UI Design’ is something to always refer back to
            as web designers for a good UI are crucial to having a great user
            experience and as web developers that is what we want, we do not
            want the user to be unable to use our website – as if that is the
            case our website will not be used for it has bad UI. The reading
            touched on some of the basics that we need to try to implement into
            our UI Design which I found to be very useful and allowed me to
            think about how I want to make my website a better design, not just
            for me but for the users.

          <h2>week five</h2>
          <p>
            Process on website: Within this week I managed to gather all the
            images I needed for my website and make the final cuts on where
            certain elements needed to be, such as discarding my portfolio
            section that had a mini section titled runway due to not having
            enough information to put in there. Then I finally managed to
            implement a menu button for when you enter my various pages from my
            home page, so that you are able to go back, there are a few errors
            such as certain works not showing and the bar hiding under some text
            and images, however I plan to fix this in the weeks to come.
          </p>

          <h2>week six</h2>
          <p>
            Process on website: In this week I finally figure out how to make my
            images in my portfolio section clickable, it took a couple of
            trial-and-error runs, but I managed to get there in the end, and I
            am excited to see it work! Another thing I also loved to see work
            was my hover feature on my home page so that when people hover over
            the various page name a little grey line expands beneath it and the
            user can know which page they will be selecting on and that it in
            fact is clickable.
          </p>

          <h2>week seven</h2>
          <p>
            My experience in developing my website: As it is the second last
            week before our website is due, I have managed to get where I needed
            to be. It has shown me that when I look back on my initial
            wireframes, how a lot of what I wanted to do needed to go as it was
            not working out and some of it did not fit my aesthetic. Along the
            way I also encountered some problems such as some of my icons not
            showing and my menu bar not working, however in this week and the
            weeks to come I plan to try and fix all of this before the
            submission of my website.

            IxD Process Mashup Lecture: When looking at the IxD design process
            when I look at what I have done so far and what I have not they can
            be seen as follows, I have worked on what is known as my goal
            alignment for website and I am still currently working on the other
            factors within my IxD document.
          </p>

            Reflection on Reading: When we look at the article on ‘User
            Experience – A Research Agenda’ by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky dives
            into the concept of user experience and discusses a better method
            when trying to understand and define user experience. One of the
            writers' main issues is the requirement for a precise definition of
            UX. They contend that, while user experience (UX) is a frequently
            used term in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and
            design, there is still no agreement on its meaning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With this the reading shows us why there is a need for us to explore
            the various dimension of user experience. Overall, the essay gives
            useful insights into the idea of user experience and recommends a
            study agenda to expand our understanding of this topic. It
            highlights the need of having a clear concept of UX, exploring
            multiple elements of UX, taking context into account, and using
            qualitative approaches in UX research.
